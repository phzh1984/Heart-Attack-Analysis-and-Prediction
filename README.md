# Heart-Attack-Analysis-and-Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health parameters and characteristics of individuals. The dataset used for this analysis contains information related to patients' health factors and whether they are prone to a heart attack.

Dataset Description

The dataset comprises the following features:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Sex of the patient

cp: Chest pain type

trtbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results

thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved

oldpeak: Previous peak

slp: Slope

caa: Number of major vessels

thall: Thalium Stress Test result

exng: Exercise-induced angina

Additionally, there is a target variable:

output: Likelihood of a heart attack (0 = less chance, 1 = more chance)

Analysis and Prediction

This dataset is utilized to perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling to understand the relationship between these health attributes and the likelihood of a heart attack. Classification algorithms can be employed to predict the probability of a person being prone to a heart attack based on their health parameters.
